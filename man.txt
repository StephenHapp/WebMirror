Usage:
python3 launch.py [options]

Some options are required, namely the project's destination directory and a path to
a text file containing links to download as layer 0:

python3 launch.py dest:"./my_web_site" layer0:"./layer_0_links.txt" [options]

Each option takes one or more values. The option name and values are separated
by colons. Different options are separated by spaces. There is no enforced order
for options to appear.
